## About this repository

This repository contains all the programs that I wrote or was working on within my 16 week intense Software Engineering skills bootcamp provided by **HyperionDev**.
Some of the tasks are very simple and basic but I still have them all here as this is the start of my journey into programming.

Each **Task** folder contains:
  - subfolder **My Code** that contains the *program(s)* I worked on,
  - pdf file that includes material about topic and task instructions.

If you have anything on your mind regards the tasks that you would like to discuss, head to **Discussions** section and let's talk.

This is link to my **HyperionDev portfolio** that shows the progress of tasks, task grades and reviews of my tasks: https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/148596/
