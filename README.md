# My-HyperionDev-Bootcamp-Tasks

This repository contains all my tasks (that involves writing or working with code) I have worked on within my 16 week intense Software Engineering skills bootcamp provided by HyperionDev.

Each Task is in a seperate folder and contains codes I worked on and a subfolder.
# Subfolder contains:
  - pdf file that includes material about topic and task instructions at last pages
  - example codes
  - may also have additional material that supports the tasks or topic covered

This is link to my HyperionDev portfolio that shows the progress of tasks, task grades and reviews of my tasks: https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/148596/

Sadly GitHub in this bootcamp is covered as one of the last tasks so there is no version history to the projects I worked on prior, however I am adding features and updating previous projects as I learn something new.
