## About this repository

This repository contains all the programs that I wrote or was working on within my 16 week intense Software Engineering skills bootcamp provided by **HyperionDev**.
Some of the tasks are very simple and basic but I still have them all here as this is the start of my journey into programming.

Each **Task** folder contains:
  - subfolder **My Code** that contains the *program(s)* I worked on,
  - pdf file that includes material about topic and task instructions,
  - may also have additional material that supports the tasks or topic covered,
  - example codes/programs.

If you have anything on your mind regards the tasks that you would like to discuss, head to **Discussions** section and let's talk.

Sadly GitHub in this bootcamp is covered as one of the last tasks so there is no version history to the projects I worked on prior, however I am adding features and updating previous projects as I learn something new.

This is link to my **HyperionDev portfolio** that shows the progress of tasks, task grades and reviews of my tasks: https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/148596/
