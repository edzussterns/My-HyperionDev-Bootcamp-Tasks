## About this repository

This repository contains all the code that I wrote or was working on within my 16 week intense Software Engineering skills bootcamp provided by **HyperionDev**.

Each **Task** folder contains:
  - subfolder **My Code** that contains the code files I worked on,
  - pdf file that includes material about topic and task instructions at last pages,
  - may also have additional material that supports the tasks or topic covered,
  - example codes.

If you have anything on your mind regards the tasks that you would like to discuss, head to **Discussions** section and let's connect.

This is link to my **HyperionDev portfolio** that shows the progress of tasks, task grades and reviews of my tasks: https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/148596/

Sadly GitHub in this bootcamp is covered as one of the last tasks so there is no version history to the projects I worked on prior, however I am adding features and updating previous projects as I learn something new.
